<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The goals of this assignment are two-fold:</p>

<ol>

<li>To introduce you to sorting data on disk using mergesort.

<li>To compare the performance of different algorithms for creating
and merging runs during mergesort.

</ol>

<h2>Index File</h2>

<p>During this assignment you will sort a binary index file of integer
key values. The values are stored in the file in a random order. You
will use a mergesort to produce a second index file whose key values
are sorted in ascending order.</p>

<h2>Program Execution</h2>

<p>Your program will be named <code>assn_3</code> and it will run from
the command line. Three command line arguments will be specified: a
mergesort method, the name of the input index file, and the name of
the sorted output index file.</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 8px;">
assn_3 mergesort-method index-file sorted-index-file
</div>

<p>Your program must support three different mergesort methods.</p>

<div style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
<table style="margin-left: 7.5%; margin-right: 7.5%;">
<tr>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 8px 8px 0px;">1.</td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; white-space: nowrap; padding: 0px;">
    <code>--basic</code>
  </td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 8px; text-align: justify;">
    Split the index file into sorted runs stored on disk, then merge
    the runs to produce a sorted index file.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 8px 8px 0px;">2.</td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; white-space: nowrap; padding: 0px; ">
    <code>--multistep</code>
  </td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 8px; text-align: justify;">
    Split the index file into sorted runs. Merge subsets of runs to
    create super-runs, then merge the super-runs to produce a sorted
    index file.
  </td>

<tr>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 8px 8px 0px;">3.</td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; white-space: nowrap; padding: 0px; ">
    <code>--replacement</code>
  </td>
  <td style="border-width: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 8px; text-align: justify;">
    Split the index file into sorted runs created using replacement
    selection, then merge the runs to produce a sorted index file.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>For example, executing your program as follows</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 8px;">
assn_3 --multistep input.bin sort.bin
</div>

<p>would apply a multistep mergesort to <code>input.bin</code> to sort
it ascending by key value. The result would be stored
in <code>sort.bin</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> For convenience, we refer to the input index file
as <code>input.bin</code> and the output sorted index file
as <code>sort.bin</code> throughout the remainder of the
assignment.</p>


<h2>Available Memory</h2>

<p>Mergesort's run sizes and merge performance depend on the amount of
memory available for run creating and merging runs.</p>

<p>Your program will be assigned one input buffer for reading data
(<i>e.g.</i>, blocks of keys during run creation of parts of runs
during merging). The input buffer must be sized to hold a maximum of
1000 integer keys.</p>

<p>Your program will also be assigned one output buffer for writing
data (<i>e.g.</i>, sorted blocks of keys during run creation or sorted
subsets of <code>sort.bin</code> during merging). The output buffer
must be sized to hold a maximum of 1000 integer keys.</p>


<h2>Basic Mergesort</h2>

<p>If your program sees the merge method <code>--basic</code>, it will
implement a standard mergesort of the keys in <code>input.bin</code>.
The program should perform the following steps.</p>

<ol>

<li>Open <code>input.bin</code> and read its contents in 1000-key
blocks using the input buffer.

<li>Sort each block and write it to disk as a run file. You can use
any in-memory sorting algorithm you want (e.g.,
C's <code>qsort()</code> function). Name each run
file <code>index-file.<i>n</i></code>, where <code><i>n</i></code> is
a 3-digit run identifier, starting at 0. For example, if the input
index file is <code>input.bin</code>, the run files would be named

<div class="codeblock"
style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px;">
input.bin.000
input.bin.001
input.bin.002
 ...
</div>


<li>Open each run file and buffer part of its contents into the input
buffer. The amount of each run you can buffer will depend on how many
runs you are merging (<i>e.g.</i>, merging 50 runs using the 1000-key
input buffer allows you to buffer 20 keys per run).

<li>Merge the runs to produce sorted output. Use the output buffer to
write the results in 1000-key chunks as binary data
to <code>sort.bin</code>.

<li>Whenever a run's buffer is exhausted, read another block from the
run file. Continue until all run files are exhausted.

</ol>

<p>You must record how much time it takes to complete the basic
mergesort. This includes run creation, merging, and writing the
results to <code>sort.bin</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> You will never be asked to merge more than 1000 runs
in Step 3. This guarantees there will always be enough memory to
assign a non-empty buffer to each run.</p>


<h2>Multistep Mergesort</h2>

<p>If your program sees the merge method <code>--multistep</code>, it
will implement a two-step mergesort of the keys
in <code>input.bin</code>.  The program should perform the following
steps.</p>

<ol>

<li>Create the initial runs for <code>input.bin</code>, exactly like
the basic mergesort.

<li>Merge a set of 15 runs to produce a super-run. Open the first 15
run files and buffer them using your input buffer. Merge the 15 runs
to produce sorted output, using your output buffer to write the
results as binary data to a super-run file.

<li>Continue merging sets of 15 runs until all of the runs have been
processed. Name each super-run
file <code>index-file.super.<i>n</i></code>,
where <code><i>n</i></code> is a 3-digit super-run identifier,
starting at 0. For example, if the input file
is <code>input.bin</code>, the super-run files would be named

<div class="codeblock"
style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 8px;">
input.bin.super.000
input.bin.super.001
input.bin.super.002
 ...
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 2px;">
<b>Note.</b> If the number of runs created in Step 1 is not evenly
divisible by 15, the final super-run will merge fewer than 15 runs.
</div>

<li>Merge all of the super-runs to produce sorted output. Use the
input buffer to read part of the contents of each super-run. Use the
output buffer to write the results in 1000-key chunks as binary data
to <code>sort.bin</code>.

</ol>

<p>You must record how much time it takes to complete the multistep
mergesort. This includes initial run creation, merging to create
super-runs, merging super-runs, and writing the results
to <code>sort.bin</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> You will never be asked to merge more than 1000
super-runs in Step 3. This guarantees there will always be enough
memory to assign a non-empty buffer to each super-run.</p>

<h2>Replacement Selection Mergesort</h2>

<p>If your program sees the merge method <code>--replacement</code>,
it will implement a mergesort that uses replacement selection to
create runs from the values in <code>input.bin</code>. The program
should perform the following steps.</p>

<ol>

<li>Divide your input buffer into two parts: 750 entries are reserved
for a heap <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> ... <i>H</i><sub>750</sub>, and 250
entries are reserved as an input buffer <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>
... <i>B</i><sub>250</sub> to read keys from <code>input.bin</code>.

<li>Read the first 750 keys from <code>input.bin</code> into <i>H</i>,
and the next 250 keys into <i>B</i>. Rearrange <i>H</i> so it forms an
ascending heap.

<li>Append <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> (the smallest value in the heap) to
the current run, managed through the output buffer. Use replacement
selection to determine where to place <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>.

<ul class="sub">

<li>If <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> &le; <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, replace
<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> with <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>.

<li>If <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> &gt; <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, replace
<i>H</i><sub>1</sub> with <i>H</i><sub>750</sub>, reducing the size
of the heap by one. Replace <i>H</i><sub>750</sub> with
<i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, increasing the size of the secondary heap by
one.

</ul>

Adjust <i>H</i><sub>1</sub> to reform <i>H</i> into a heap.

<li>Continue replacement selection until <i>H</i> is empty, at which
point the current run is completed. The secondary heap will be full,
so it replaces <i>H</i>, and a new run is started.

<li>Run creation continues until all values in <code>input.bin</code>
have been processed. Name the runs exactly as you did for the basic
mergesort
(<i>i.e.</i>, <code>input.bin.000</code>, <code>input.bin.001</code>,
and so on).

<li>Merge the runs to produce sorted output, exactly like the merge
step in the basic mergesort.

</ol>

<p>You must record how much time it takes to complete the replacement
selection mergesort. This includes replacement selection run creation,
merging the replacement selection runs, and writing the results
to <code>sort.bin</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> You will never be asked to merge more than 1000 runs
in Step 6. This guarantees there will always be enough memory to
assign a non-empty buffer to each run.</p>


<h2>Programming Environment</h2>

<p>All programs must be written in C, and compiled to run on
the <code>remote.eos.ncsu.edu</code> Linux server. Any ssh client can
be used to access your Unity account and AFS storage space on this
machine.</p>


<h4>Measuring Time</h4>

<p>The simplest way to measure execution time is to use
<code>gettimeofday()</code> to query the current time at appropriate
locations in your program.</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 8px;">
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

struct timeval tm;

gettimeofday( &tm, NULL );
printf( "Seconds: %d\n", tm.tv_sec );
printf( "Microseconds: %d\n", tm.tv_usec );
</div>

<p>Comparing <code>tv_sec</code> and <code>tv_usec</code> for
two <code>timeval</code> structs will allow you to measure the amount
of time that's passed between two <code>gettimeofday()</code>
calls.</p>


<a name="writing_results">
<h4>Writing Results</h4>
</a>

<p>Sorted keys must be written to <code>sort.bin</code> as binary
integers. C's built-in file writing operations allow this to be done
very easily.</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 0px;">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

FILE *fp;                  /* Output file stream */
int   output_buf[ 1000 ];  /* Output buffer */

fp = fopen( "sort.bin", "wb" );
fwrite( output_buf, sizeof( int ), 1000, fp );
fclose( fp );
</div>

<p>Your program must also print the total execution time for the
mergesort it performs as a single line on-screen. Assuming the
execution time is held in a <code>timeval</code> struct called
<code>exec_tm</code>, use the following <code>printf</code> statement
to do this.</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 0px;">
printf( "Time: %ld.%06ld", exec_tm.tv_sec, exec_tm.tv_usec );
</div>

<p>Your assignment will be run automatically, and the output it
produces will be compared to known, correct output
using <code>diff</code>. Because of this, <b>your output must conform
to the above requirements exactly</b>. If it doesn't,
<code>diff</code> will report your output as incorrect, and it will be marked
accordingly.</p>


<a name="supplemental_material">
<h2>Supplemental Material</h2>
</a>

<p>In order to help you test your program, we provide
example <code>input.bin</code> and <code>sort.bin</code> files.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="input.bin"><code>input.bin</code></a>, a binary input
file file containing 250,000 keys,

<li><a href="sort.bin"><code>sort.bin</code></a>, a binary output file
containing <code>input.bin</code>'s 250,000 keys in ascending sorted
order.

</ul>

<p>You can use <code>diff</code> to compare output from your program
to our <a href="sort.bin"><code>sort.bin</code></a> file.

<p>Please remember, the files we're providing here are meant to serve
as examples only. Apart from holding integers, and a guarantee that
the number of runs (or super-runs) will not exceed the input buffer's
capacity, <b>you cannot make any assumptions</b> about the size or the
content of the input and sort files we will use to test your
program.</p>


<!--
<h4>Test Files</h4>

<p>The following files were used to test your program.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Basic:</b>
<a href="test/basic.zip"><code>basic.zip</code></a>

<li><b>Multistep:</b>
<a href="test/multi.zip"><code>multi.zip</code></a>

<li><b>Replacement Selection:</b>
<a href="test/repl.zip"><code>repl.zip</code></a>
</ul>

<p>Each zip file contains three test scenarios in separate
subdirectories: a simple case, a normal case, and a large case. For
example, <code>basic.zip</code> has three
subdirectories: <code>basic-simple</code>, <code>basic</code>,
and <code>basic-large</code>.
</p>

<p>Within each subdirectory is an input file
(<code>input-simple.bin</code>, <code>input.bin</code>,
and <code>input-large.bin</code>, respectively), all intermediate run
files, and a final <code>sort.bin</code> sorted output file. We
<code>diff</code>'d these known, correct intermediate run files and
the sorted output file to your results to test your program.
</p>

<p><code>diff</code> will only tell you if two binary files are the
same or different. It will not tell you where they differ. If you want
to investigate exactly <i>why</i> your binary files differ from ours,
you can download and compile this program.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="test/dump.c"><code>dump.c</code></a>
</ul>

<p>Running <code>dump binfile</code> will dump the contents of a
packed binary integer file as text, one line per integer. You can
redirect results from <code>dump</code> to generate text versions of
the two binary files you want to compare, then <code>diff</code> those
text files.
</p>

<div class="codeblock" style="margin-top: 8px;">
% gcc -o dump dump.c
% dump input.bin.000 > input.txt.000
% dump my-input.bin.000 > my-input.txt.000
% diff input.txt.000 my-input.txt.000
</div>

<p>
Now, <code>diff</code> will tell you exactly which lines (<i>i.e.,</i>
which integers) are different.
</p>

<h2>Hand-In Requirements</h2>

<p>Use <a href="https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/?term=current&type=complex&what=CSC%20541" target="_blank">Moodle</a> (the online assignment submission
software) to submit the following files:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>assn_3</code>, a Linux executable of your
  finished assignment, and
	
  <li>all associated source code files (these can be called anything
  you want).

</ul>

<p>There are four important requirements that your assignment must
satisfy.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Your executable file must be named exactly as shown above. The
  program will be run and marked electronically using a script file,
  so using a different name means the executable will not be found,
  and subsequently will not be marked.

  <li>Your program must be compiled to run
  on <code>remote.eos.ncsu.edu</code>. If we cannot run your program,
  we will not be able to mark it, and we will be forced to assign you
  a grade of 0.

  <li>Your program must produce output that exactly matches the format
  described in the <a href="#writing_results">Writing Results</a>
  section of this assignment. If it doesn't, it will not pass our
  automatic comparison to known, correct output.

  <li>You must submit your source code with your executable prior to
  the submission deadline. If you do not submit your source code, we
  cannot MOSS it to check for code similarity. Because of this, any
  assignment that does include source code will be assigned a grade of
  0.
